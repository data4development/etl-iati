= Set up Hop
:navtitle: Hop

== Download and install Hop

Download Hop https://hop.apache.org/download/[from the Hop website^].

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the easiest approach is to set up the software on the local machine.

There is a Docker version with a web server,
where the whole application is served in the browser.
However, setting this up with a project in a repository is not tested,
nor documented at this moment.
====

== Choose a config and audit folder

Hop stores information about your local setup in two folders:

* The config folder has information about your local configuration,
projects and environments.
* The audit folder has logging and history information.

By default, Hop uses folders within the installed application folder.
This makes it more tricky to replace that with a newer version.

Use environment variables to specify different locations.

.Example alternative locations
[source, sh]

HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER=$HOME/hop/config
HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER=$HOME/hop/audit
