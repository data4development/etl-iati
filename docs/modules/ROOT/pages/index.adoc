== History

In 2005, Kettle started as open source ETL tool, with a visual programming interface.
It turned into Pentaho Data Integration.
In 2019, the original authors created a fork to allow experimentation to develop it further.
The project was brought under the stewardship of the Apache Foundation, and named Hop.
